## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Smartwatch Sync
Officer wears any BLE-compatible fitness tracker (Apple Watch, Garmin, Fitbit).  
If heart rate drops below 30 BPM or irregular rhythms detected, drone launches.

### 2️⃣ Autonomous Flight Modes

| Mode | Action |
|------|--------|
| **GUARDIAN**  | Tracks officer's GPS, hovers at 3m for protection |
| **PURSUIT**  | Auto-tracks suspects via thermal imaging | 15m safe altitude |
| **BLACKBOX**  | Records 4K evidence, even in low light |
| **CALLBACK**  | Auto-dials 112 with location & live feed |

### Emergency Dialing System
- Automatically detects country via GPS and calls:
  - **112** in European Union countries
  - **911** in United States/Canada
  - **000** in Australia
  - **999** in UK

### 3️⃣ Voice Alerts & Deterrents
"Drop your weapon! Backup is en route!" – Drone speakers warn suspects.
